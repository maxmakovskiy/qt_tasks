Pragmatism

Arch is a pragmatic distribution rather than an ideological one.
The principles here are only useful guidelines.
Ultimately, design decisions are made on a case-by-case basis through developer consensus.
Evidence-based technical analysis and debate are what matter, not politics or popular opinion.
The large number of packages and build scripts in the various Arch Linux repositories offer free and open source software for those who prefer it, as well as proprietary software packages for those who embrace functionality over ideology.
